    "Solar flares are sudden explosions of energy that occur on the Sunâ€™s surface. They often occur in solar active regions (ARs), caused by strong magnetic fields typically associated with sunspot areas. Solar flares are categorized into five classes A, B, C, M, and X, with A-class flares having the lowest intensity and X-class flares having the highest intensity. Major flares are usually accompanied by coronal mass ejections and solar energetic particles1. These eruptive events can have significant and harmful effects on or near Earth, damaging technologies, power grids, space stations, and human life. Therefore, providing accurate and early forecasts of solar flares is crucial for disaster risk management, risk mitigation, and preparedness.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we present a transformer-based framework, named SolarFlareNet, for predicting whether an AR would produce. we attempt to use SDO/HMI vector magnetic field data together with flaring history to predict solar flares that would occur in an AR within 24, 48, and 72 hr of a given time point."
